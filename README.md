Hi, I’m @gunnaero
Gunn Aeronautics Association is a student-run rocketry team from Gunn High School in Palo Alto California. We compete in the annual TARC competition, as well as running outreach programs and a bunch of other rocketry-related things!
This is where all the open sourced code for the Gunn Aeronautics rocketry team will go, such as:
- nice-to-have homebrew rocketry related libraries
- open-sourced avionics schematics
- and whatever else we find useful!
